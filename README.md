Testing out Git-hub

Hi there, I'm Alauz and I've been lurking on Git-hub for the past several years and finally decided to jump in to help with the open source projects. I've some experience in coding for Windows, Linux, Mac OS as well as mobile platforms Android and iOS. I love helping out others with their problems when implementing cross-platform coding.

Languages worked with include: C/C++, C#, F#, Java, Javascript, Python, Ruby, SQL and XML.
Platforms used include: Adobe Phonegap, Borland, Cordova, Eclipse & Unity
Operating Systems used include: Android, iOS, Linux (Debian/Fedora), Mac OS, MS DOS, Solaris, Unix, Windows

My hobbies include: Artificial Intelligence, Gaming, History, Poetry, Programming, Philosophy, Reading, Robotics & Technology Spotting

My personal motto: Learn something new everyday, an idiot today, a genius tomorrow. 
I am passionate about creating something new for others to enjoy.
